Extracting Data from the Web
****************************

Web Scraping
============

The internet makes a vast quantity of data available.

But not always in the form or combination you want.

It can be nice to combine data from different sources to create *meaning*.


Data Sources
------------

Data online comes in many different formats:

* Simple websites with data in HTML
* Web services providing structured data
* Web services providing tranformative service (geocoding)
* Web services providing presentation (mapping)

Let's concentrate today on that first class of data, HTML.

HTML Data
=========

Ideally HTML would be well-formed and strictly correct in it's structure:

.. code-block:: html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>A nice clean paragraph</p>
        <p>And another nice clean paragraph</p>
      </body>
    </html>


But in fact, it usually ends up looking more like this:

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
     <form>
      <table>
       <td><input name="input1">Row 1 cell 1
       <tr><td>Row 2 cell 1
      </form>
      <td>Row 2 cell 2<br>This</br> sure is a long cell
     </body>
    </html>


An Internet Law: "Be strict in what you send and tolerant in what you receive"
